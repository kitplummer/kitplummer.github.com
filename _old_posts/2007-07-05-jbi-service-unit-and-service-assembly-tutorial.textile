I created this screencast a while back to show a few in-house developers how to create Service Units and Service Assemblies for deploying to ServiceMix.

Might be worth looking at.  The maven archetype commands need some updating to get with the current [FUSE](http://www.logicblaze.com/content/view/67/99/) release.  Also, IONA should be assuming the FUSE product line shortly - so FUSE may show up over at http://www.iona.com soon enough.
