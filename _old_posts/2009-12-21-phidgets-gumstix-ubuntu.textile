title: Phidgets (Gumstix) and Ubuntu 9.10
---

h1. {{ page.title }}
Well, it's that time of the year ago...my home automation spirit kicks in, and the robot pieces come out of the closet.  

It started with a rebuild of my dev environment.  Said to say that the Gumstix docs still suck.  I was able to get my dev enviro, based on Ubuntu 9.10, with the help of the mailing list.

Then it was installing the Linux drivers for the "Phidget":http://www.phidgets.com SDK.  They installed no problem, but I couldn't get the drivers to actually load when I installed a device.  I figured something was missing around _udev_.  Sure enough...just needed to set _udev_ up.

<pre><code>$ sudo cp udev/99-phidgets.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/</code></pre>

and

<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/udev restart</code></pre>

The I ran both the example _manager_ and the Servo Test that comes with the standardC examples SDK.

I was also able to get a version of the Phidgets SDK to compile against my OpenEmbedded Gumstix enviro.  The Bitbake recipe is "here":http://github.com/kitplummer/phidgets-oe - maybe somebody will find it and run.
