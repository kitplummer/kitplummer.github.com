title: SOA & SEI
---

It's official: SOA is for real!

"SEI Course @ SEI":http://www.sei.cmu.edu/news-at-sei/whats-new/coursesoa2.htm validates it.  Here's the course "details":http://www.sei.cmu.edu/products/courses/p59.html

I always find it interesting how various technologies, methodologies, etc. can be around for decades - and all it takes to for them to find legitimacy is a strange relationship, or a back-page note in a trade magazine.  I'm not saying that SOA isn't legit already - but, the commercial and Open Source arenas have really been in "build it and they will come" mode (especially with Web Services and the newer Enterprise Service Bus concept).

It will be interesting to see what kind of impact SEI has on justifying SOA to F50 company's IT shops.  I also did notice that SEI has done well not to mention Java, or any implementation language for that matter...
