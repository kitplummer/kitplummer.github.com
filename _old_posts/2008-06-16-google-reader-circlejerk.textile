title: Google Reader Circle-Jerk...

I'm posting this blog article.  Which will then show up in my Google Reader because it is going to automatically get piped their from somebodies Yahoo! Pipe.  Once it shows up in Reader, I'm going to share it...which will cause it to show up in my Google Reader Share ( "http://www.google.com/reader/shared/03419463208734067981":http://www.google.com/reader/shared/03419463208734067981 )...causing it to cycle around again.  I'm kind of curious what other ill-effects happen (browser melt-down, pink-slip action, etc.)

Here's the tinyurl (for my shares): "http://tinyurl.com/6s5kop":http://tinyurl.com/6s5kop
