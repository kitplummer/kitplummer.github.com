title: Back to Ruby, MacOS X Upgrade...
---

Well...it has been a while since I've had a chance to do _anything_ with Ruby, which sucked.  I'd figured I start with upgrading Ruby itself since the version I've installed (default) is 1.8.6.  But, since 1.8.7 is the current (all the dev must be going into 1.9+) I figured updating RubyGems and all of my gems would be the best place to start.

I instantly hit a wall with 'gem update --system' or even 'gem update'.

But thanks to the Internet and people hitting this problem many months back I found solutions:

Merbivore was killing me first, solution found "here":http://kl93.blogspot.com/2008/08/add-and-remove-remote-source-from-gem.html

Then, I ran into an issue with an older version of RubyGems itself.  Found a decent blog "here":http://www.theodorenguyen-cao.com/2008/11/08/undefined-local-variable-or-method-remote_gemspecs/ describing the steps to resolve - upgrading RubyGems to 1.3.1.

Phew...I'd have hated to have had to figure it out myself.  On to playing with "RSS feed parsing":http://nasir.wordpress.com/2007/12/03/rss-feeds-ruby-on-rails-web-app/.
