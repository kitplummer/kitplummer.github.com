h1. {{ page.title }}

Oh the shame.  Three months since my last post.  Trust me, good stuff was happening...I was collecting a paycheck (the hard way).

Just want to spread the word.  Me and the tribe are congregating for the second rev of the MilOSS Working Group.

"Check it!":http://miloss.org

We're meeting in DC!  August 2 through the 5th, culminating with a BarCamp (and Ignite sessions through the week evenings).

If you have interests in or around life, liberty and the pursuit of open source we're expecting you.
