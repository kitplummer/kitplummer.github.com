"MIL-STD-2525B":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APP-6A is a subset/cousin of a STANAG standard for military symbology.  We're interested in these symbols as map icons.  There's "proprietary":http://www.objectraku.com/06_prodserv/symbolsindex.htm options - but, that forces a specific library/framework.  

Obviously, especially within the Mil/DoD space, not everything makes sense to be an Open Source Software project.  But, then somethings just lend themselves to the "Open Technology Development":http://www.acq.osd.mil/jctd/articles/OTDRoadmapFinal.pdf ideals.

Where there is low intellectual property and high-potential for existing OSS reuse - it's one of those latter prospects.

All I want to be able to do is retrieve the appropriate icon based on a given "symbol code":http://webhelp.esri.com/arcgisdesktop/9.1/body.cfm?tocVisable=1&ID=2778&TopicName=Symbol%20ID%20code

Nothing complicated and sounds like a great web-based service (read API) candidate right?

I've talked to at least four different people with different organizations who've all purported to have solved this problem internally.  I'm trying to work within the "Mil-OSS":http://www.mil-oss.org working group here and "GTRI":http://www.gtri.gatech.edu/ (as well as within Accenture) to find a good starting point.  But, maybe in this case it is worth just getting something starting - and hoping the _build it and they will come_ attitude works.

This is likely a Forge.mil candidate - but, I can't help feel like it makes sense for this thing to be fully "Open".

Thoughts?
