title: Hacking Smack in Groovy
---

h1. {{ page.title }}

Really just testing the "gist":http://gist.github.com 'embed' feature.  But, figured I shared a couple of things here:

<script src="http://gist.github.com/137619.js"></script>

Unfortunately, it appears that gist doesn't support syntax highlighting for Groovy (real bummer).  Hidden in my Groovy script there is a closure-based Java Interface implementation.  By declaring the closure "as PacketExtension" I'm able to really simply do some cool XML magic on XMPP messages. 

More to come here...as I'll need to consume that sucka via an ExtensionProvider (me thinks).
