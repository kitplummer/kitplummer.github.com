title: It Has Been a While (Worthless Internet)...
---

Sometimes I feel like I'm in front of the majority with regard to technology and the Internet.  But, every once and a while I come across something that makes me feel like I'm still living in '99.  I recently read a blog somewhere that referenced this music site where you could punch in my favorite band's name and get a playlist full music that I'd love.  So, I clicked the link - but there were some problems with my employer's firewall preventing my access to the site.  

Six months later I saw a news flash about a CBS music site that was supposed to do the same thing.  Following the link I end up at [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm).  Last.fm is the most intelligent thing I've seen (as a technophile) for some time.  Last.fm is built on [Audioscrobbler](http://www.audioscrobbler.net) which is a incredible database of data and statistics.  The information is used to deliver me the best music experience.

Amazing.  I've found so many bands that I think are amazing - mostly from outside of the U.S.

Last.fm offers a downloadable, stand-alone client to stream music.  And, they even have a [MacOS X version](http://www.last.fm/download/) - select the Apple option.  

I won't bother with all of the details, but will highly recommend if you are at all interested in music, regardless of genre, you need to check out Last.fm.

Enjoy.  [CBS](http://startupsquad.com/2007/05/30/cbs-snaps-up-lastfm/) is.
