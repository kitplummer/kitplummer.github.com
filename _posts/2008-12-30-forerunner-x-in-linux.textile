title: Forerunner 30x in Linux...
---

I've been 'toying' with using my "Garmin":http://www.garmin.com Forerunner 30x training GPSes in Linux.  I'd been having all kinds of problems getting "gpsd":http://gpsd.berlios.de to work with it.  Neither my 301 or 305 units are "supported" by gpsd - but, there was plenty of posts floating in the Interstew that led me to believe it _could_ be done.

The key ingredient was this dandy diddle:

<pre>
$ sudo mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb/ 
</pre>

I accidentally found it in an "Ubuntu forum":http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=642999 and to my surprise I was quickly able to get gpsd working.

Now, on to the fun stuff - reading gpsd from Ruby.  :-)
