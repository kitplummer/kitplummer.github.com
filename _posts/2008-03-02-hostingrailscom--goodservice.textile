title: HostingRails.com - goodservice

So, I'm not one to give praise often...but, sometimes it is just worth it.

I recently went to work on adding the Facebook badge to my Mephisto theme's layout.liquid...and noticed that Rails was barfing regularly on the "admin" section.  So, after a bit of digging I found that "HostingRails.com":http://www.hostingrails.com had updated to Rails 2.x - which of course Mephisto is imcompatible with.  After following the fixes noted on their Wiki I still couldn't get the "admin" section to dispatch.  So...I figured I drop in on a 3-week old "thread":http://www.hostingrails.com/forums/deployment_troubleshooting_thread/846 and post that I was still having the same problem.

To my surprise (and I hope the guy is a staffer) because he checked my database.yml settings and found out that the infamous MySQL socket: config was pointing to the wrong file.  He fixed that.  But, I continued to have problems so I drop another note on the thread.  The same guy checked that the Rails version that I froze to support Mephisto - and it was incorrect, which is strange because I followed the settings from the Wiki.  Just magic hosting...and great support.
