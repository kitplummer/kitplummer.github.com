title: Thank You Askimet!

For curiosity’s sake I turned off my blog’s [spam protection,
Askimet,](http://www.askimet.com) to see what would happen.

My mistake, to say the least. With one day I had over 120 spam comments
across all of the posts which hadn’t closed their comments. Crazy. What
is the point of posting a bunch of “lorus ipsum” into blog comments? Let
alone a blog which no one reads. ;)
