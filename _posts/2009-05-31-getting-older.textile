I'm starting to realize that all the abuse I put on my body in my younger years is exposing itself.  I'm also starting to realize that if I don't do something about it, the second half of my life is going to suck.  I'm not out-of-shape, given today's standards of shape (and how effed-up that is).  I'm 5'8" at 168.  I could probably run a 10k right now, even with a torn meniscus and an evident case of osteoarthritis.  But in my mind I'm out-of-shape.  Since breaking my hand a few years ago, my upper body (all the way to my brain) has succumb to atrophy.  The signs are disheartening for sure.  All things considered I don't eat badly; I stopped drinking soda and coffee.  I suppose if I were rich and handsome I'd buy a sports car and ...

Even my 10-yo is kicking my butt in video games.  We just received "FIFA09":http://www.fifa09.ea.com/us from "GameFly":http://www.gamefly.com yesterday and it took two games before he was beating with evenly matched teams, and he's never played futbol before in his life.  Twerp.  But, I'll take all that - he's growing up nicely.

Just last week my 15-yo was complaining about breaking a nail playing the drums.  I called him a 'girly man' and he used a surprise attack to get me to the floor.  I still pinned him...but, geez.  I know that it is only a matter of time before I will hope that our duels are only of the mind.  But, even then I'm not sure.  I'll take that too.

I couldn't be more proud of my wife...who's 30-something days from returning from a Air National Guard deployment to the Middle East.  The past 6 months haven't been easy for any off us - but, we are all doing our part, without any doubt or regret.  It isn't pleasant being away from a loved one I assure you that.  At the same time it isn't that hard.  I take comfort in my family, and I know they do the same.  We just understand.

All that said I really am liking growing older.  I see with clarity, literally and figuratively.  I'm connected to so many people - past and present.  And, the potential for the future is great.  Sure, our world is struggling to find its way - but, I have confidence.

Professionally, the stars seem to be aligning.  Open source which I for so long have evangelized is finally getting its due.  Not just Linux, or commercially - but socially.  Again it is the potential and the timing.  The bridge between embedded and enterprise, both from a software and hardware perspective is slimming - ubiquity is possible.  Shoot, open source hardware is very near to mainstream.

I'm not really sure what the point of this post was...just mental venting.  :)
