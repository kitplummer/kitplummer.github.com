Radio?  Yep.  

"Software Engineering Radio":http://www.se-radio.net/ does exist.  And, it is amazingly good.  By good I mean useful.  Granted it isn't going to help you learn a particular language, but listening to the episodes will make you a better software engineer/developer - especially if you can understand and relate the content to your particular function.

The content coverage is also quite good.  So, if you're looking for something to fill out a bit of time on your iPod - check 'er out.
