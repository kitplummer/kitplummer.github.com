title: Grails 1.1, Hudson and Maven...[Redacted]
---

So, I recently created a new project based on Grails 1.1, which I needed
wrap with Maven. Grails 1.1 IS ready for prime time. With the
maven-grails-plugin I was able to simply call ‘mvn install’ from my
Hudson CI environment - even with no Grails 1.1 installation on the CI
server. Very, very cool. Great work from the Grails camp!

\[Note: I had to backtrack on my previous post…sorry.\]
