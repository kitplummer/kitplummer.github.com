title: Agile Practices and Software Maintenance...
---

I recently wrote a non-traditional paper looking at how it might be possible to integrate Agile practices into a software maintenance activity.  Academically I don't expect the paper to go over so well - but, believe it might be of interest to some who've been asked the same questions as me.

The paper uses a very simple "helloworld" application written in Ruby and highlights a few really cool Ruby tools.

Anyway "here's the paper in PDF form":http://blackholelogic.com/assets/2008/4/21/Software_Engineering_and_Practical_Agile_Maintenance.pdf - feedback always appreciated.

I've also written a very similar paper on the potential for IV&V integration into an Agile project.  I'll probably post this one as well in the near future.
