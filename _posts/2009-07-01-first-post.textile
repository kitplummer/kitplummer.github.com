h1. {{ page.title }}

Dog fooding.  I'm not exactly sure how this term came about, but for us techies it means using what we build.  Since I'm pushing GitHub:FI as a piece of Accenture's BCIP solution stack I figure it would be good to try and show GitHub's inherent innovation.  Thus, I'll be blogging about our BCIP work here, rather than my personal blog at "black:hole:logic":http://blackholelogic.com.

I did throw out a teaser: "http://www.blackholelogic.com/2009/6/30/social-coding-in-the-dod":http://www.blackholelogic.com/2009/6/30/social-coding-in-the-dod which is the unofficial blogging kick-off.

More to come shortly.
