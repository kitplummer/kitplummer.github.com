Well, I couldn’t be more excited (and proud). The boys are falling right
in line. :-)

Caiden received an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) starter kit
yesterday and he jumped right in, even choosing to hack over American

Layne has been bitten. It didn’t take much…I suppose “the first car”
thing helps, but still pretty cool. We have until October to get ’er
cleaned up and road worthy.

I’m looking forward to playing, I mean working with both of ’em and
there latest interests.

Nevermind the stuff on my plate. Eesh…gonna be a fun-filled summer.
