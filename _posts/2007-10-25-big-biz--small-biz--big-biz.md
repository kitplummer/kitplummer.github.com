title: Big Biz -> Small Biz -> Big Biz

Although I think it is good for the company (at least the principles) I
don’t believe this good for me (outside of my resume).

I recently left a 75000+ person company, intentionally for a SMB. My
holy grail SMB, is now being sucked in to a 135000+ person company. Ugh.

Apart from the clout the ‘accenture’ name brings, which I’m not sure the
DoD will give two \#@\#\*s about there is a disturbing affect that big
business culture has on small business efficiencies. I can only hope
that the strategy is ‘laisez faire’ and the Gestalt unit stays
technically in tact. But, we all know it is only a matter of time,
before all are assimilated.

So, Accenture - here we come. I am looking forward to it - to meet new
people and take advantage of the internal resources (labs) that are
available. Wonder what their policy on Macs is? Man, that could be a
show-stopper.
