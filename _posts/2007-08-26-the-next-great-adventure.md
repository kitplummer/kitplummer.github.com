title: The Next Great Adventure...
---

On to the next great adventure. Tomorrow I am starting with a
consulting(ish) company called [Gestalt](http://www.gestalt-llc.com/) -
and very excited, and anxious at the same time.

It really is a fear of the unknowns. But, there are a few things that I
do know. I will be working with [Brian
O’niell](http://brianoneill.blogspot.com/) ([here
too](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/boneill42/)), and [Jim
Stogdill](http://limnthis.typepad.com/), a couple of really smart
people. Gestalt’s play in the [GIGlite](https://www.giglite.org/) arena
is an indication of their willing to be
[Open](http://opentechdev.org/index.php/Main_Page).

My role as a Technical Architect will be a new one. Although, I’ve
architected my share of systems, it has always been a byproduct of
“waterfall” methodologies - and was never intentional. Generally, my
teams simply built systems based on the knowledge at hand. Another great
indicator of the things to come is Gestalt’s
[PathFinder](http://www.gestalt-llc.com/method/index.html). Formal
acceptance of a methodology that promotes the flexibility to do new
things is something I’m very much looking forward to.

This will also be my first go around with working completely remote. I’m
looking forward to this as well…I’m instantly getting 2 hours of my day
back (minus commute and 9+hour days). I’m a work-a-holic anyway, now I
get to be an efficient and flexible work-a-holic. Right now, I’m
planning on “openly” documenting my day-to-day stuff, as function of
[GTD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done). We’ll see how
that goes. I still haven’t solved a problem with publishing blog posts
from [Journler](http://journler.com/)

I’m also planning on re-joining the JBI 2.0 EG (JSR-312) as an
individual participant, and probably a couple others. In addition, it
appears that [ServiceMix](http://www.servicemix.org) 4.0 efforts are
going to be highly influential to the JBI 2.0 effort. Things are looking
good there.

I’m also creating a generic wish list of stuff that I hope to get to
work on/with:

-   [OSGi](http://www.osgi.org)
-   [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)
-   [Jabber](http://www.jabber.org)
-   [MANET/IPv6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_IPv6)
-   [Open Technology
    Development](http://opentechdev.org/index.php/Main_Page)
-   Enterprise development patterns, applied to embedded/tactical
    problems (read Java in devices)
-   Open Source leadership

So, here’s to it. Tally-ho!
