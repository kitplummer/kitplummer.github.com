title: Scrum != Agile.
---

Agile Software Development needs to separate itself from Scrum. And,
Scrum needs to quit doing agile such a disservice.

I’ve seen it a few times now where agile practices, get the root cause
treatment for flailing methodologies. I hear way too often “we’re an
agile shop; we do Scrum.” And, I’m also seeing more and more
organizations attempting to apply Scrum to CMM-centric projects.

First Step: Remove agile from methodologies. Agile practices should
stand alone, as simple actions taken by individuals, teams, and
stakeholders in support of any given methodology. \[Good agile practices
won’t preclude process success, but can prevent many process pitfalls.
[Practices](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer)
can make {closer to} perfect {software} - but, process can not.\]

Second Step: Accept that Scrum is not agile, in of itself. \[Just
because the process is broken down to more iterative steps does not
imply agile anything. In fact it could be concluded that the real
[Agile](http://agilemanifesto.org) says they aren’t related at all:
“Individuals and interactions over processes and tools”.\]

Obviously, there’s a lot more to be said here. I’m intentionally keeping
this short…with the hopes that I will continue the thought in
subsequent, more focused, posts.
