title: SFC Stadtler's Innovation

{{ page.title }}
================

Gunnar Hellekson, Lead Architect for Red Hat Government, has a [great,
great story on battlefield innovation](http://onepeople.org/node/1600) -
and the need for more of it. This story was made possible by Sergeant
1st Class Stadtler’s skills. Now imagine if we had a growing pool of the
skills, provided by a platform that enhanced collaboration and open
knowledge.

Perhaps our BCIP infrastructure wouldn’t be a feasible platform for a
“fielded” runtime, but it could allow for his solutions to be shared,
reused, and refined across the entire Army (or even the DoD).

Great stuff Gunnar, thanks. And thank you SFC Stadtler - you rock!
