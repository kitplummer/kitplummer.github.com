title: This Is Why I Love Open Source...
---

<pre>
checking whether to support zlib... using included version
checking for libusb... checking for libusb-config... true
checking for usb_interrupt_read in -lusb... yes
checking for random stuff to make you feel better... failed
</pre>

To protect the innocent I'll keep the app protected...but, I just love the embedded humor.  And to top it all off "./configure" failed to find anything random to make me feel better.  Geez.
