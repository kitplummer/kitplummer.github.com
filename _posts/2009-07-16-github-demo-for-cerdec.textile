title: GitHub Demo for Army CERDEC

h1. {{ page.title }}

!>/images/logo_fi.png! On Friday we'll be presenting a simple demonstration of a GitHub:FI install, one that we've slightly modified for our project.  I can't say enough good things about the GitHub:FI installer and setup - especially knowing how complex it is trying to deploy a SaaS as a deliverable.  Aside for a few "early release" things it works amazingly well.

Stay tuned for the real feedback.

Also lots of great discussion about GitHub versus Forge.mil in the Mil-OSS community - with a desire for the former.  Good stuff.
