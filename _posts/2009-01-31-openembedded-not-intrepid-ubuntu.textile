title: OpenEmbedded not Intrepid (Ubuntu)...
---

I've run in to many different issues trying to build "OpenEmbedded":http://wiki.openembedded.net/ or recipes on Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid.  The list kept getting longer, with fixes to some and workarounds to others.  Just setup a new 8.04LTS (server) VM and all works clean, straight-out-of the box.  Back to progress...and thanks to the Gumstix mailing list for not responding to my question, forcing me to give this a shot.  ;)
