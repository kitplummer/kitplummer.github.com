title: Blog Post From TextMate?
---

Testing from a blog post from "TextMate":http://www.macromates.com!

If this works, I'm gonna be stoked...

My blog is "Mephisto":http://mephistoblog.com, which is coming along just nicely.  Though I have yet to run 'er through a live upgrade.  We'll see then just how happy I am with it.

Mephisto uses "XMLRPC":http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi to support to posting transactions...way cool!
