We, being my oldest son Layne and me - though he doesn't really know it yet.  I've sparked some interest for coding via basic robotics.  We've also been playing with interaction via Jabber.  This particular project is the basis for an incoming message notifier (waving servo).  We'll probably be posted another which provides a control interface via a Python-based Jabber bot.

Pretty cool.  We should have more stuff soon.  Part of the fun was skinning "Redmine":http://www.redmine.org as our project hosting site.

(Also getting a big head start on this year's science fair project.)
