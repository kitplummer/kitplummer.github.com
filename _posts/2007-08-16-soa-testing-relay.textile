Passing on the links:

From over at the "SOA Center":http://www.soacenter.com/?p=117

SOA testing is a necessary evil.  More necessary is acceptance that Open Standards must exist first.  How can one possible test SOA without having something to test?  Models and Sims?

WS, JBI, SCA - all require independent testing.  Beyond SOA testing, there needs to be BPEL and ESB testing...system(s) as a whole.  End-to-End testing is a huge complicated thing...and white-box, black-box testing enough.  I think at some point the value of each level of testing should be evaluated for necessity.  Being realistic, the ole "good enough" probably applies for most cases.

Just thought there were some good words, worthy of relaying on...
