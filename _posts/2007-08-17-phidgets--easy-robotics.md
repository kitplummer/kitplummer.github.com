USB to Single Servo board:

This costs less than 40 bucks and has API support for Windows, MacOS X,
Linux, and WinCE and language support for Java, C/C<span
class="underline"></span>, Flash and some scripting languages (through
the community). Way cool.

I’ve used a few different Phidget products ( plugging in to the also
way-cool [Gumstix](http://www.gumstix.com) ) including some RFID kits.
They have all been extremely high quality. I wish I had a real project
that used them…
