title: Tucson Emerging Software Symposium...
---

I’ve got a new ambition: a Tucson software development/engineering
symposium. Right now, I’m thinking September or October.

I’ve got some good role model events:

[No Fluff Just Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com) and [Philly’s
Emerging Tech](http://www.phillyemergingtech.com).

So, here’s a few of my thoughts.

-   a single day event
-   run on Saturday
-   start at 8:30
-   sessions end at 3
-   central to town (u of a?)
-   rest of day social/hack sessions
-   15-18, 30 minutes sessions in two tracks
-   cover “hot” topics (rails/grails, agile, tdd/bdd, open sourcing,
    ruby/python, robotics)
-   get sponsorship from raytheon, intuit, ventana, arizona center for
    innovation, ibm, saic, etc.
-   limit attendee seats to 200
-   cost at \~$100
-   all proceeds go to building a computer science/software engineering
    summer camp for kids.

Any feedback?
