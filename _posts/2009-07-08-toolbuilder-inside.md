title: ToolBuilder Inside?

{{ page.title }}
================

Sometimes timing is everything. :) Thanks to Peter for posing this great
idea - that [We should all be tool
makers](http://www.gadgetocracy.com/?p=39)

If you’re not familiar with [the BUG](http://buglabs.net) - shame on
you.

Obviously Peter’s intent is to create an ecosystem of tool makers, by
making available his product, the BUG, Open Source (both the hardware
and software). ’‘’Cool!’’’

We agree, that by putting toolmaker’s tools in the hands of individuals,
we can create ToolBuilders. Please don’t read too deep into this, but we
see a very similar opportunity that was afforded the average computer
user by Microsoft Access, Excel and VisualBasic - tool maker’s tools.
There’s no doubt that many data/information problems have been solved
(and are still being solved) by using these widely available tools.

Who knows, maybe there is a place for the BUG in BCIP. That sure would
be cool.
