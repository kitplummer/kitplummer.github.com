title: Microsoft at EclipseCon...
---

I’m trying to figure out why there’s a couple of Microsoft guys sitting
next to me at the hotel bar, here at EclipseCon. I would ask them…but,
after hearing their completely lame discussion about dual-monitor
workstations there’s no way I’m striking up a conversation.

Amazing. Even the smelly elephant gets invited to the party.
