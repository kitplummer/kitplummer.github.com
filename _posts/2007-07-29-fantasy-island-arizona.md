Way cool ride today with Layne (my oldest son) and buddy James. Wasn’t
downhill; wasn’t x-country - but really fun. Capped it off with Layne
pulling out a park bench and rounding up a nice plank - we each took
turns riding the bench and popping off. Of course, as soon as James
says: “Layne, your just looking for a ride to the ER” - sure enough
Layne wheelies off the bench, lands it on the rear turn and rolls about
3 foot and loops ’er out. Slam, right on the ole tooky. As soon as the
smile hits Layne we all had a good laugh. Thanks Layne and James.
