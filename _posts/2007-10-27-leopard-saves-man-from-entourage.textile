title: Leopard Saves Man from Entourage.
---

Finally, finally, finally.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  Apple has finally given me the last piece of the pie.  I can now officially kick that PoS Entourage to the curb.

The hanging chad has been the calender integration.  Until now, I had no good way of accepting, declining meetings.  The solution is still crap, but it will at least remove Entourage from being a "requirement".

I'm not sure why Apple can't just do what Entourage does and give me the opportunity to accept, decline, or say tentative.  But, what they have given me is this:

Microsoft Outlook Web Access: the url to Outlook's web interface.  Weird, but is enough progress.  I suppose it really isn't Leopard, but an updated Apple Mail.  I'm not sure about the rest of Mail, but that is enough.
