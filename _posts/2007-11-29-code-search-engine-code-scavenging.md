title: Code Search Engine - Code Scavenging
---

Good post [here](http://blog.slickedit.com/?p=183) covering the concept
of Code Scavenging. I’m not quite sure it deserves methodology…how ’bout
just “practice”. I totally agree that Reuse is a troublesome, and oft
over-utilized “ility”. But, considering that the majority of software
work is maintenance (fixing, enhancing) reusing “snippets” of code makes
great sense. Kudos to Scott Hackett for throwing the relevance out
there.

I think that most software work now is integration-centric - even on the
front-end of projects. There’s just so much out there - from code to
frameworks and platforms. The chances are that someone’s already done
what you need to do…you just have to “scavenge” for it.
